                <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is essential to sustainable development. Currently, the world is facing a global health crisis unlike any other — COVID-19 is spreading human suffering, destabilizing the global economy and upending the lives of billions of people around the globe.
                    Before the pandemic, major progress was made in improving the health of millions of people. Significant strides were made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with child and maternal mortality. But more efforts are needed to fully eradicate a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and emerging health issues. By focusing on providing more efficient funding of health systems, improved sanitation and hygiene, and increased access to physicians, significant progress can be made in helping to save the lives of millions.
                    Health emergencies such as COVID-19 pose a global risk and have shown the critical need for preparedness. The United Nations Development Programme highlighted huge disparities in countries’ abilities to cope with and recover from the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic provides a watershed moment for health emergency preparedness and for investment in critical 21st century public services.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><p>The pandemic and other ongoing crises are hindering progress in achieving SDG3, exacerbating existing health inequalities and threatening progress towards universal health coverage. As a result, 68 million children are known to be un- or under-vaccinated as of 2022 from TB and malaria increased. This has been particularly challenging in low- and middle-income countries, where health systems were already under-resourced before the pandemic. The pandemic has also highlighted the need for stronger global health security systems to prevent and respond to future pandemics. Overcoming these setbacks and dealing with longstanding shortcomings in health-care provision requires an urgent strengthening of health systems.</p>
            <ul><li><b>Target 3.1: </b>The global maternal mortality ratio decreased only from 227 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015 to 223 in 2020, still over three times higher than the target of 70 maternal deaths by 2030. This means that almost 800 women are still dying from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth every day. Almost 95% of these deaths occurred in low and lower-middle-income countries. The global average annual rate of reduction was only 0.04% in the period of 2016-2020, significantly lower than the 2.7% rate in 2000-2015. To meet the target, the annual rate of reduction needs to increase to 11% between 2020 and 2030. In 2022, 86% of global births were attended by skilled health personnel, which increased from 81% in 2015, but coverage in sub-Saharan Africa was only 70%.</li>
            <li><b>Target 3.2: </b>Between 2015 and 2021, the global under-5 mortality rate fell by 12% from 43 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015 to 38 deaths and the global neonatal mortality rate fell from 20 to 18 deaths.  In 2021, 5 million children died before reaching their fifth birthday—down from 6.1 million in 2015.  Of 200 countries and areas analysed, only 54 countries are not on track to meet the target of lower than 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. Among these countries, 37 countries will need to more than double their current rate of progress or reverse a recent increasing trend to achieve the SDG target by 2030.</li>
            <li><b>Target 3.3: </b>Progress towards the SDG target of ending communicable diseases by 2030 remains off course eventhough progress varies across different diseases. <br>a) Tremendous progress has, for instance, been made in reducing new HIV infections, particularly in the highest-burden regions: the estimated 1.5 million new HIV infections in 2021 was almost one-third fewer than in 2010. This is however still far from the 2025 target of fewer than 370,000 new HIV infections as agreed by the UN General Assembly in 2021. <br>b) In 2021, an estimated 1.6 million people died from TB and 10.6 million people fell ill with TB, an increase from 10.1 million in 2020. The TB incidence rate rose by 3.6% between 2020 and 2021, reversing declines of about 2% per year for most of the previous two decades. Between 2015 and 2021, the net reductions in TB incidence and TB death were 10% and 5.9%, respectively, only one-fifth and one-tenth of the way to the 2025 milestone of WHO’s End TB Strategy. <br>c) There were an estimated 247 million malaria cases globally in 2021, compared to 224 million in 2015. There were an estimated 619,000 malaria deaths globally in 2021 compared to 625,000 in 2020 and 568,000 in 2019. d) Despite significant disruptions caused by COVID-19, the global number of people requiring treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) declined from 1.8 billion in 2015 to 1.65 billion in 2021. Notably, in LDCs, 47% of the total population required NTD treatment and care in 2021, down from 79% in 2010.</li>
            <li><b>Target 3.7: </b>The proportion of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods has been increasing slightly from 76.5% in 2015 to 77.6% in 2023 and is projected to reach 78.2% by 2030 – strong progress but still not sufficient to meet the target of ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services by 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa has witnessed the largest increase from 51.6% to 57.4% for this period and is expected to increase to 62.1% by 2030. </li>
            <li><b>Target 3.b: </b>The percentage of children who received three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) fell 5 percentage points between 2019 and 2021 to 81%, causing the largest sustained decline in childhood vaccinations in approximately 30 years. As a result, 25 million children missed out on one or more doses of DTP through routine immunization services in 2021 alone. This is 2 million more than those who missed out in 2020 and 6 million more than in 2019. The global coverage of the last dose of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, targeting 9-14 years old girls to prevent cervical cancer, was only 12% in 2021.</li>
            <li><b>Target 3.c: </b>A 2020 study shows that the projected global shortage of health workers by 2030 has reduced from 18 million to 10 million. Despite the tremendous increase in health workforce globally, regions with the highest burden of disease continue to have the lowest proportion of health workforce to deliver health services. According to data from 2014-2021, sub-Saharan Africa continues to have the lowest health worker density, with only 2.3 medical doctors and 12.6 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 population. In contrast, Europe has the highest density of 39.4 doctors per 10,000 population, while North America has 152 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 population.</li>
